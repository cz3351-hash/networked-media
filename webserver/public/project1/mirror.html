<p class="monospaced">I see myself in the mirror
    <br/>
    <br/> I see some long <span class="bold">black</span> hair
    <!-- <br/><span class="light"> - I bleached them underneath, but I probably can't see them in mirror, the mirror's too small for that</span> -->
    <br/> I see a pair of light eyebrows
    <br/> I see my <span class="greenish bold">greenish-black</span> glasses
    <br/> I see <span class="brown bold">brown</span> eyes
    <br/> I see a nose
    <br/> I see my mouth
    <br/> I see my ears 
    <!-- <span class="small">(I just got a new piercing on the right!)</span> -->
 <br/>  <br/>  <br/><span class="italic small">if I take one step back...</span> 
 <br/>  <br/> I'll see a cap on my head
<br/> sometimes its the <span class="blue bold">blue</span> one, other times its the <span class="lightbrown bold">brown</span> one
    <!-- <br/> <span class="light">and maybe I could see my roommate, Christina, by her desk</span> -->
